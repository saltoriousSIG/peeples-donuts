# Copy this to .env.local and uncomment to enable mock mode for UI testing

# Enable mock mode - simulates transactions without actually sending them
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_TRANSACTIONS=true

# Mock user segment - determines which UI state to show
# Options: new_user | shareholder_no_pin | pin_no_flair | active_earner | yield_ready
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_USER_SEGMENT=yield_ready

# Quick reference for user segments:
# - new_user: No pin, no shares → shows paid onboarding (flair picker + amount + mint)
# - shareholder_no_pin: Has shares but no pin → shows free pin claim
# - pin_no_flair: Has pin but no flair equipped → shows "Get Flair to Start Earning"
# - active_earner: Has pin + flair but no yield yet → shows "Yield accumulating..."
# - yield_ready: Has pin + flair + claimable yield → shows yield amount + claim button
